# 🧮 Task 5: Data Analysis on CSV Files
## 🎯 Objective
Analyze sales data using Python and Pandas to extract meaningful business insights.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

---

## 📁 Dataset
- A CSV file containing sales data.
- Columns used (example): `Date`, `Product`, `Sales`

---

## 📌 Key Steps
1. Load the CSV file using `pandas.read_csv()`
2. Explore the dataset with `head()`, `info()`, `describe()`
3. Clean and format data (convert `Date`, handle nulls if any)
4. Use `groupby()` and `sum()` to aggregate sales:
   - Total sales by product
   - Monthly sales trends
5. Visualize results using `plot()`, `bar()`, `line()` with Matplotlib/Seaborn

---

## 📊 Charts & Visualizations
- Bar chart showing **Total Sales by Product**
- Line chart showing **Monthly Sales Trend**

---

## ✅ Outcome
- Extracted basic business insights from raw CSV data
- Practiced using `groupby`, `sum`, and `plot` with Pandas
- Gained experience with EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) on tabular data

---
